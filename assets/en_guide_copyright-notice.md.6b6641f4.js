<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"> of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.</span></span>

<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  The licenses for most software are designed to take away your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">freedom to share and change it.  By contrast, the GNU General Public</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">License is intended to guarantee your freedom to share and change free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">software--to make sure the software is free for all its users.  This</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">General Public License applies to most of the Free Software</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Foundation&#39;s software and to any other program whose authors commit to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">using it.  (Some other Free Software Foundation software is covered by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the GNU Lesser General Public License instead.)  You can apply it to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">your programs, too.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">this service if you wish), that you receive source code or can get it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">if you want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">in new free programs; and that you know you can do these things.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  To protect your rights, we need to make restrictions that forbid</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">anyone to deny you these rights or to ask you to surrender the rights.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">These restrictions translate to certain responsibilities for you if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute copies of the software, or if you modify it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  For example, if you distribute copies of such a program, whether</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">gratis or for a fee, you must give the recipients all the rights that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">you have.  You must make sure that they, too, receive or can get the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">source code.  And you must show them these terms so they know their</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">rights.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  We protect your rights with two steps: (1) copyright the software, and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">(2) offer you this license which gives you legal permission to copy,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute and/or modify the software.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  Also, for each author&#39;s protection and ours, we want to make certain</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">that everyone understands that there is no warranty for this free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">software.  If the software is modified by someone else and passed on, we</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">want its recipients to know that what they have is not the original, so</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">that any problems introduced by others will not reflect on the original</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">authors&#39; reputations.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  Finally, any free program is threatened constantly by software</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">patents.  We wish to avoid the danger that redistributors of a free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">program will individually obtain patent licenses, in effect making the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">program proprietary.  To prevent this, we have made it clear that any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">patent must be licensed for everyone&#39;s free use or not licensed at all.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  The precise terms and conditions for copying, distribution and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">modification follow.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">                    GNU GENERAL PUBLIC LICENSE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">   TERMS AND CONDITIONS FOR COPYING, DISTRIBUTION AND MODIFICATION</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  0. This License applies to any program or other work which contains</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">a notice placed by the copyright holder saying it may be distributed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">under the terms of this General Public License.  The &quot;Program&quot;, below,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">refers to any such program or work, and a &quot;work based on the Program&quot;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">means either the Program or any derivative work under copyright law:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">that is to say, a work containing the Program or a portion of it,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">either verbatim or with modifications and/or translated into another</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">language.  (Hereinafter, translation is included without limitation in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the term &quot;modification&quot;.)  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Activities other than copying, distribution and modification are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">covered by this License; they are outside its scope.  The act of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">running the Program is not restricted, and the output from the Program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">is covered only if its contents constitute a work based on the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Program (independent of having been made by running the Program).</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Whether that is true depends on what the Program does.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  1. You may copy and distribute verbatim copies of the Program&#39;s</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">source code as you receive it, in any medium, provided that you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">conspicuously and appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">copyright notice and disclaimer of warranty; keep intact all the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">notices that refer to this License and to the absence of any warranty;</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">and give any other recipients of the Program a copy of this License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">along with the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">You may charge a fee for the physical act of transferring a copy, and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">you may at your option offer warranty protection in exchange for a fee.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  2. You may modify your copy or copies of the Program or any portion</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">of it, thus forming a work based on the Program, and copy and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute such modifications or work under the terms of Section 1</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">above, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    a) You must cause the modified files to carry prominent notices</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    stating that you changed the files and the date of any change.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    b) You must cause any work that you distribute or publish, that in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    whole or in part contains or is derived from the Program or any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    part thereof, to be licensed as a whole at no charge to all third</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    parties under the terms of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    c) If the modified program normally reads commands interactively</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    when run, you must cause it, when started running for such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    interactive use in the most ordinary way, to print or display an</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    announcement including an appropriate copyright notice and a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    notice that there is no warranty (or else, saying that you provide</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    a warranty) and that users may redistribute the program under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    these conditions, and telling the user how to view a copy of this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    License.  (Exception: if the Program itself is interactive but</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    does not normally print such an announcement, your work based on</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    the Program is not required to print an announcement.)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">These requirements apply to the modified work as a whole.  If</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">identifiable sections of that work are not derived from the Program,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">and can be reasonably considered independent and separate works in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">themselves, then this License, and its terms, do not apply to those</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">sections when you distribute them as separate works.  But when you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute the same sections as part of a whole which is a work based</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">on the Program, the distribution of the whole must be on the terms of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">this License, whose permissions for other licensees extend to the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">entire whole, and thus to each and every part regardless of who wrote it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Thus, it is not the intent of this section to claim rights or contest</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">your rights to work written entirely by you; rather, the intent is to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">exercise the right to control the distribution of derivative or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">collective works based on the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">In addition, mere aggregation of another work not based on the Program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">with the Program (or with a work based on the Program) on a volume of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">a storage or distribution medium does not bring the other work under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the scope of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  3. You may copy and distribute the Program (or a work based on it,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">under Section 2) in object code or executable form under the terms of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Sections 1 and 2 above provided that you also do one of the following:</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    a) Accompany it with the complete corresponding machine-readable</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    source code, which must be distributed under the terms of Sections</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    1 and 2 above on a medium customarily used for software interchange; or,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    b) Accompany it with a written offer, valid for at least three</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    years, to give any third party, for a charge no more than your</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    cost of physically performing source distribution, a complete</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    machine-readable copy of the corresponding source code, to be</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    distributed under the terms of Sections 1 and 2 above on a medium</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    customarily used for software interchange; or,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    c) Accompany it with the information you received as to the offer</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    to distribute corresponding source code.  (This alternative is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    allowed only for noncommercial distribution and only if you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    received the program in object code or executable form with such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">    an offer, in accord with Subsection b above.)</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">The source code for a work means the preferred form of the work for</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">making modifications to it.  For an executable work, complete source</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">code means all the source code for all modules it contains, plus any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">associated interface definition files, plus the scripts used to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">control compilation and installation of the executable.  However, as a</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">special exception, the source code distributed need not include</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">anything that is normally distributed (in either source or binary</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">form) with the major components (compiler, kernel, and so on) of the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">operating system on which the executable runs, unless that component</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">itself accompanies the executable.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">If distribution of executable or object code is made by offering</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">access to copy from a designated place, then offering equivalent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">access to copy the source code from the same place counts as</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribution of the source code, even though third parties are not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">compelled to copy the source along with the object code.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  4. You may not copy, modify, sublicense, or distribute the Program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">except as expressly provided under this License.  Any attempt</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">otherwise to copy, modify, sublicense or distribute the Program is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">void, and will automatically terminate your rights under this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">However, parties who have received copies, or rights, from you under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">this License will not have their licenses terminated so long as such</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">parties remain in full compliance.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  5. You are not required to accept this License, since you have not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">signed it.  However, nothing else grants you permission to modify or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute the Program or its derivative works.  These actions are</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">prohibited by law if you do not accept this License.  Therefore, by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">modifying or distributing the Program (or any work based on the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Program), you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so, and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">all its terms and conditions for copying, distributing or modifying</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the Program or works based on it.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  6. Each time you redistribute the Program (or any work based on the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Program), the recipient automatically receives a license from the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">original licensor to copy, distribute or modify the Program subject to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">these terms and conditions.  You may not impose any further</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">restrictions on the recipients&#39; exercise of the rights granted herein.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">You are not responsible for enforcing compliance by third parties to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  7. If, as a consequence of a court judgment or allegation of patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">infringement or for any other reason (not limited to patent issues),</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">otherwise) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">distribute so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">may not distribute the Program at all.  For example, if a patent</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">license would not permit royalty-free redistribution of the Program by</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">all those who receive copies directly or indirectly through you, then</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the only way you could satisfy both it and this License would be to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">refrain entirely from distribution of the Program.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">If any portion of this section is held invalid or unenforceable under</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">any particular circumstance, the balance of the section is intended to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">apply and the section as a whole is intended to apply in other</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">circumstances.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">It is not the purpose of this section to induce you to infringe any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">patents or other property right claims or to contest validity of any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">such claims; this section has the sole purpose of protecting the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">integrity of the free software distribution system, which is</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">implemented by public license practices.  Many people have made</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">generous contributions to the wide range of software distributed</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">through that system in reliance on consistent application of that</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">system; it is up to the author/donor to decide if he or she is willing</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">to distribute software through any other system and a licensee cannot</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">impose that choice.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">This section is intended to make thoroughly clear what is believed to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">be a consequence of the rest of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  8. If the distribution and/or use of the Program is restricted in</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">certain countries either by patents or by copyrighted interfaces, the</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">original copyright holder who places the Program under this License</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">may add an explicit geographical distribution limitation excluding</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">those countries, so that distribution is permitted only in or among</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">countries not thus excluded.  In such case, this License incorporates</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">the limitation as if written in the body of this License.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  9. The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">of the General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">address new problems or concerns.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the Program</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">specifies a version number of this License which applies to it and &quot;any</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">later version&quot;, you have the option of following the terms and conditions</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">either of that version or of any later version published by the Free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Software Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">this License, you may choose any version ever published by the Free Software</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Foundation.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  10. If you wish to incorporate parts of the Program into other free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">programs whose distribution conditions are different, write to the author</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">to ask for permission.  For software which is copyrighted by the Free</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">Software Foundation, write to the Free Software Foundation; we sometimes</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">make exceptions for this.  Our decision will be guided by the two goals</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">of preserving the free status of all derivatives of our free software and</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">of promoting the sharing and reuse of software generally.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">                            NO WARRANTY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  11. BECAUSE THE PROGRAM IS LICENSED FREE OF CHARGE, THERE IS NO WARRANTY</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF ALL NECESSARY SERVICING,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">REPAIR OR CORRECTION.</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;"></span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">  12. IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MAY MODIFY AND/OR</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">REDISTRIBUTE THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES,</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">INCLUDING ANY GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING</span></span>

<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">YOU OR THIRD PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">PROGRAMS), EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE</span></span>
<span class="line"><span style="color:#A6ACCD;">POSSIBILITY OF SUCH DAMAGES.</span></span>
