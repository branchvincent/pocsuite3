Our aim is to serve the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need actionable data right away.</p><p>Official website: <a href="https://www.exploit-db.com" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">https://www.exploit-db.com</a></p>',8),o=[s];function l(n,p,d,b,h,u){return t(),a("div",null,o)}var g=e(r,[["render",l]]);export{f as __pageData,g as default};
